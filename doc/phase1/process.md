Part 6

For phase 1 of our project, we kept our team organized and on task by having effective and
consistent communication between our group members. In order to achieve this, we
implemented a private group chat on Skype. This private group chat was mainly used by the
different group members to discuss any problems or issues which came up. This allowed all
group members to be constantly aware of everyone's progress which helped keep the
surprises to a minimum. In addition to the chat group online, we also had scrum meetings
regularly.

During the first scrum meeting, we delegated the tasks for phase 1 of the assignment
between the four group members. During our first inperson
meeting, we brainstormed ideas about what features we would like to have on our search engine. 
We also managed to roughly design how we wanted the layout for different pages on our search 
engine to look like. In our meetings, all decisions were decided by discussing between each other why we would
want to implement certain features/ideas. 

Generally, we weighed the benefits of adding against consequences of implementing the new feature.
Mainly, we met frequently to have inperson meetings discussing various ideas/features we
wanted to implement into the search engine. We also had a lot of constant communication
with each other by utilizing the online chat group we set up.

In order to ensure that each group member was always informed, we had constant
communication on the online chat group. In case of emergencies, we also had each other’s
contact numbers incase of any last minute issues that might have came up. We
communicated with each other frequently using different volumes to talk about new ideas or
to quickly update each other on different individual’s progresses.

The priority for our user stories, is to have the general underlying functionalities of the search
engine working. This includes create/login account, upload files, and to be able to
search/view files stored on the search engine. We also rated the user stories by having
implementation of the querying process to be the hardest task followed by storing, managing
and displaying different information about users and files.

For the next phase of the project, the biggest lesson we have learned from phase 1 is to
have our meetings start earlier and to be more organized in designing/presenting the ideas
we want to implement.
