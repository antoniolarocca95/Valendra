Project objectives:
1. Create a search engine that is user friendly and designed to search through user uploaded documents.

2. Design a rating and comment system to better sort documents for user accessibility.

3. Design a search system to help students find other students to study with.

Based on our project objectives, our key users/personas that we will be dealing with are: Students, usually in their 20's. The students will most likely have an understanding of technology but will like for things to be simple. Professors, they can be in a wide range of ages. Some may not be so technologically inclined so we should make sure to keep that in mind.

Some problems our search engine will solve are; students being unable to find other students to study with, students searching for extra accessible content for their courses and professors providing extra content easily.

We should strive to keep the system simple while still keeping the functionality. We do not want to drive users off with a complicated system. Search speed is also important and should be a priority in the build.
