1. You guys are not using separate branches for your work. All work is going on the master branch. 

2. No pull requests are being issued by any of the team member. 

3. Not possible to generate the burn down chart in your sprint, because you have no initial estimates OR actual work being tracked correctly. 

4. No commits except for couple maybe, that are mapped to JIRA. Rest of the commits in bitbucket are orphaned. 

5. Three snapshots of your Task Board: in the beginning of the first Sprint, in the middle, and at the end of the first Sprint. These must be committed into BitBucket under directory sprint1Docs.
