—Decent use of branching and JIRA.

—Lot of work remains to be done. 
Just have the uploading feature and the search feature on console based. No front end? No backend and no servlet? No proper use of JIRA in terms of actual time estimation i.e. bringing task to completion and setting up estimation of tasks. 

Mark: 3.0/5
