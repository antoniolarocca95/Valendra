To run any of our code, a tomcat server must be set up.
tomcat should be running from /opt/tomcat
Inside webapps our website 'Valendra' needs a folder.
All of the files inside of HTML go in this folder.
There must be a folder called filesDirectory that has proper permissions for the server to write to it.
Inside WEB-INF a lib folder must contain all the java dependancies listed in the pom.xml
Inside WEB-INF a classes folder must contain all our classes in the same structure as they are when compiled from maven.
