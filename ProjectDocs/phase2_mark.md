## CSC301 Phase 2 Evaluation ##

### 1. Product Backlog (4.5/5) ###
   * lacks detail; could have been more specific by including a "benefit" for at least some PB items (typical format is: "As a <role>, I want <goal/desire> so that <benefit>")

### 2. Sprint Backlog (7/10) ###
   * SB isn't structured properly and is missing necessary content -- typical format: take a set of PB items, divide them into specific logical tasks, then assign those tasks

### 3. Organization and Content (7/8) ###
   * presentation of content could have been better organised by structuring PB and SB into tables
   * keep relevant content together so it's better organised and easier to follow (e.g. description of CRC cards in Phase2Document.pdf, but actual CRC cards are in seperate directory)

### 4. System Design (7/10) ###
   * no detail of the tools or technologies being used beyond just the diagram -- would have helped to include a written description of how/why you plan on using these tools
   * could have included more detail for error handling such as user errors while signing-up or logging-in

### Total: 25.5/33 ###
